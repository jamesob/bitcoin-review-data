Wow, thanks for this contribution @david-bakin. These are some really
fine-grained tests for various Taproot related parts of the script interpreter.
The code here is very readable and seems extensible, if a little wordy
sometimes.

For many parts of the codebase, this sort of testing would be overkill IMO
because it is so tightly coupled to the tested code. But in the case of script
interpretation - debatably the heart of bitcoin validation - I think it's
worthwhile to have painstakingly involved tests at the cost of slight
maintenance burden if the underlying code happens to change somehow. Maybe
someone more experienced than me w.r.t. changing the script interpreter can
weigh in here and confirm my intuition.

All of my comments are pretty minor. I'd say it might be wortwhile to break 
out the `Parse*()` `optional` changes in the second commit either into their own
commit, or as I mentioned in a previous review, fold it into the first.
