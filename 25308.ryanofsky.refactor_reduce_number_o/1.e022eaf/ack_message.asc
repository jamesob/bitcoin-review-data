ACK e022eaf87c65e8d7d27d8f5fa4cadc359c843e8a ([`jamesob/ackr/25308.1.ryanofsky.refactor_reduce_number_o`](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/tree/ackr/25308.1.ryanofsky.refactor_reduce_number_o))

The line count reduction speaks for itself! Nice refactor. Initially I was a little
sad to lose the error value enums for the chainstate initialization functions,
but if we aren't testing on them or really using them for anything aside from
mapping to error strings, I agree that it's fine to forego them.

Read through commits locally and built each one.
