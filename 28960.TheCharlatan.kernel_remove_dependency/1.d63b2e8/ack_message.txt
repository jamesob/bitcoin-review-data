ACK d63b2e88780dc78fd531b053653361a0bf3fcbea ([`jamesob/ackr/28960.1.TheCharlatan.kernel_remove_dependency`](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/tree/ackr/28960.1.TheCharlatan.kernel_remove_dependency))

Reviewed and ran tests locally. Changes are pretty straightforward and common-sense. 

Putting event queue execution into the hands of libbitcoinkernel users seems like the right design choice, and it is especially motivating that this change helps novel fuzz testing (#29158). 

As an aside, it seems like the simplest option for users of libbitcoinkernel would be to execute the contents of the queue synchronously (i.e. drain the queue as soon as anything is pushed to it). That should be a perfectly safe way to use the library, right?
