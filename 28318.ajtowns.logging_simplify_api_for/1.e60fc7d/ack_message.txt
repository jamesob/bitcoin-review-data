ACK e60fc7d5d34f23cccbff6e4f5f3d716fa8dad50c ([`jamesob/ackr/28318.1.ajtowns.logging_simplify_api_for`](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/tree/ackr/28318.1.ajtowns.logging_simplify_api_for))

This is a definite improvement in the new-style logging interface.

I built and reviewed each commit locally, and ran `./test/functional/feature_segwit.py --nocleanup` and reviewed the resulting debug.log to sanity check.

Eventually it would be nice to unify the interface for each logging function (e.g. have the ability to specify category for Info), but personally what is written here would be an improvement over the slightly wordy `LogPrintfCategory()` equivalents that I've never found intuitive.
