code ACK 3f9112c6291cbc22a3e14bbc6f39f454b40032ca ([`jamesob/ackr/22775.1.ben-kaufman.rpc_add_option_to_list_t`](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/tree/ackr/22775.1.ben-kaufman.rpc_add_option_to_list_t))

Code looks fine, tests were a little confusing but seem to be verifying the right thing. I built and ran functional tests locally.

This seems like a fairly specific option relative to the functionality introduced in #19443. My gut inclination would be that if we're going to change the RPC API, it would make sense to put thought into something that might allow more general sorting in the way the other PR does, though the benefit here is that this change is much simpler.

Since I don't myself have a great sense of what wallet providers would find useful, it'd be nice to get commentary from multiple external projects (e.g.  Spectre, OP's project) about whether they would find this particular change worth special-casing instead of something more general, since we won't want to deprecate an arg like this shortly after introducing it if another sorting ask comes around.
