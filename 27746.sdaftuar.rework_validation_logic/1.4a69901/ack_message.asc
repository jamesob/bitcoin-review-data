Reviewed locally and built each commit.

This change is a nice tightening up of the block index management code;
the CheckBlockIndex() clarifications are welcome, not to mention fixing the
buggy setBlockIndexCandidates initialization.

The latent bugs I introduced in the original code here say a lot to me about the
wisdom (or lack thereof) of introducing unused code littered over a number of
years and PRs. I also wish I was smarter.
