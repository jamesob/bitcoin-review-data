ACK 49ee2a0ad88e0e656234b769d806987784ff1e28 ([`jamesob/ackr/22217.1.ryanofsky.refactor_avoid_wallet_co`](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/tree/ackr/22217.1.ryanofsky.refactor_avoid_wallet_co))

Change seems straightforward and benign. Just want to confirm that there's no need to update the two other calls to `updateRwSetting` in wallet/wallet.cpp (`AddWalletSetting`/`RemoveWalletSetting`).
