- [x] faf843c07f refactor: Move load block thread into ChainstateManager
Would be nice to document the new `m_load_block` thread.

- [x] fa413f07a1 move-only: Move ThreadImport to blockstorage
- [x] fa91b2b2b3 move-only: Move AbortNode to shutdown
Seems unrelated, but maybe isn't? ACK anyway.

- [x] fa0c7d9ad2 move-only: Move *Disk functions to blockstorage
- [x] fa121b628d blockstorage: [refactor] Use chainman reference where possible
- [x] fadcd3f78e doc: Remove irrelevant link to GitHub
Unrelated and I don't see why we should remove historical links to PRs from docs.
