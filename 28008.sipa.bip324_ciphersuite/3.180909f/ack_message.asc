ACK 180909f2c859be3c79630d9705c26a457715b9ed ([`jamesob/ackr/28008.3.sipa.bip324_ciphersuite`](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/tree/ackr/28008.3.sipa.bip324_ciphersuite))

Looks great. I've spent about a week ramping up on BIP-324, reading the BIPs and underlying RFC 8439, asking @sipa stupid questions about the garbage terminator, and carefully reviewing the code in this pull request. I've verified the ChaCha20-Poly1305 test vectors against an unrelated implementation (Python's chacha20poly1305, in [this script](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin-review-data/blob/master/28008.sipa.bip324_ciphersuite/verifycrypto.py).

I haven't hand-verified the BIP-325 test vectors, but I have at least verified that they are a faithful reproduction of the same vectors used to validate the example BIP-0325 Python implementation, included in the BIPs repo. So at the very least, I have verified that this implementation is a faithful reproduction of the one sketched by the BIP.

The code looks very good, and is pretty easy to follow with minor cosmetic phrasing differences from the protocol flow described in the BIP. Outside of running tests, I haven't run this branch on mainnet simply because none of the changes really interface with live codepaths; this code will certainly be used in future BIP-325 related patches, which will merit live testing. I think it is sufficient to lean on the introduced test coverage to attest to the safety of this change.
